### Visualized process for project/ Whats the gameplay 🏀 ⚾ 🏅 😄

    1. Create an array containing strings of random jokes.
    2. Generate random number using Math random, and floor in order to be inclusive of initial and later values.
    3. Create a function which can be called and return a random joke <em>soo pretty much utilising line 1 and 2<em>
    4. Create a variable which can act as a marker/counter/ possibly incrementor.
    5. Utilize a while loop to check the condition of the variable to see if application should proceed to creating jokes.
    
    6. ** Discovered multiple ways to allow for users to provide input **
        [NEED TO INSTALL VIA NPM 'PROMPT-SYNC'][https://www.npmjs.com/package/prompt-sync]
        
    7.Using the prompt package, check if user wants to keep hearing jokes, when the variable is changed to a 'NO' then the loop should break.
